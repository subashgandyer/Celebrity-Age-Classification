# Celebrity-Age-Classification
This repo contains code, doc of Machine Learning Challenge in Analytics Vidhya platform where I finished in 5th place out of 4500+ competitors.

## Objective

The objective of this DigitalVidhya Computer Vision challenge is to build a State-of-the-art classification system that will classify 3 classes of Age groups like Young, Mid and Old of Celebrities, which will position me in Top-10 of the leaderboard.

## Description

Images of different pictures of Celebrities are given. A pre-trained network like Resnet34 is used to fine-tune the classifier with these images. Images are cleaned, pre-processed and fed to the network. Deep learning model is built with the best features for discriminating these age types. The built model is optimized for generalization and accuracy. The optimized model is then validated and evaluated against the test set. I was placed 3rd in the competition out of 2200+ competitors. Top 1%
